# A Low Carbon Footprint Approach to the Reconstitution of Plastics into 3D-Printer Filament for Enhanced Waste Reduction
http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30091546/mohan-lowcarbonfootprint-2017.pdf
Investigates the parameters that must be controlled when recycling waste plastics into HDPE and ABS polymers.
## Methodology
Milk cartons & 3D-Printed waste was used to obtain HDPE and ABS respectively. They were *cut and shredded* and, subsequently, sieved with 5mm & 2.4mm meshes (pieces were no larger I guess...). 

### Filament Generation 
- The device operates
using a screw-drive which feeds the granulated material into a heating zone, where the plastic liquefies and is then extruded through a brass nozzle to form the printer filament. 
- Filament was generated using either pure HDPE or using a combination of 90% ABS with 10% HDPE by weight
- Owing to the chaotic nature of the granulation process and the variance in the resulting granule size, **only the temperature of the extruder was varied to examine to examine the influence on filament thickness**

## Results
- Good results with HDPE and ABS blend but just recycled HDPE proved less effective and required a higher extrution temperature
- recycled ABS was more effective however harder to process

# Effect of contaminants and processing regime on the mechanical properties and moldability of postconsumer polyethylene terephthalate bottles
Investigate the influence of number and type of melt processing steps and the presence of contaminants on the mechanical properties and moldability of PC-PET

## Findings
- Paper contaminants drastically reduce the toughness and mouldability of PET

# Materials Selection of 3D Printing Filament and Utilization of Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) in a Redesigned Breadboard

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2019.04.337 focused on the materials selection of virgin polymer resins and recycled post-consumer plastics for use in 3D printer filaments.

They tested virgin and recycled PET and include tensile strength, melting point, glass transition temperature, melt flow index, coefficient of thermal expansion, and cost results.

The  melting point (Tm) and melt flow index (MFI) were considered to  be  the  most  significant  parameters  in  the  extrusion  process,  therefore,  both  have  the  highest  weight  or  relative  emphasis  coefficient at 27.5%.

## Findings
- The   recycled   PET   in   extrusion   system   is   sensitive   to   temperature, thus making it susceptible to flow at low viscosity

- Its low viscosity is a consequence to an inconsistent flow rate  which produces a 3D printer filament with a non-uniform diameter. (May just require higher melting temperature)

- Recycled  PET  is  better  compared to virgin PET.

# Modification of Recycled Poly(ethylene terephthalate) for FDM 3D-Printing Applications

https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/11774/Alzahrani_Mohammed.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y  studied the suitability of recycled Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (R-PET) for 3D-pritning applications by studying the melt flow characteristics of the polymer.

R-PET is known to experience a significant deterioration in its mechanical properties when recycled due to molecular weight loss that results from reprocessing.

Lower molecular weight affects the polymer’s viscosity which hinders R-PET from being 3D-printable from two aspects.

Hypothesisied that using reactive extrusion method was a good idea

## Prelim Data
effect of moisture content and the reprocessing of R-PET on the melt flow index (MFI)value was studied: **MFI value was 400% higher when the polymer was not dried compared to  the  value  obtained  after  1  hour  of  drying**

Moreover, results showed a vast difference of around 3.5-fold in the MFI value between R-PET versus reprocessed R-PET which is  attributed  to  the  thermal  and  thermo-oxidative  degradation  that  occur  during  reprocessing. 

MFI of commercial filaments made from virgin materials (assumed) is 5-38 g/10min whereas R-PET had an MFI of 90.56 g/10min

## Results and Discussion
- PET is known to have a melting point ataround 250°C - 260°C - minimum  temperature  for  the  MFI  test  was  chosen  to  be  260°C to ensure ALL the polymer would be completely melted.

- Showed that 6hrs of drying was suitable (@100C). The graph they showed on pg.54 suggests moisture was  in after 4-6hr mark - the sample they had was made up of 0.2% moisture. 

- pg 55 shows that moisture is a BIG player in MFI and established standard practice. 

- table on pg 56 shows R-PET after two tests - you can see that virgin PETG is more consistant and has a lower MFI (5 compared to 100 g/10min) than R-PET reprocessed. 

TODO: Find process of reprocessed (something to do with re-extruded)

TODO: Find out about the PMDA chain extender - like what is it?
